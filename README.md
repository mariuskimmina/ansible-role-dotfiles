# Ansible Role: Dotfiles

Installs a set of dotfiles from a given Git repostiory. By default it will use my [dotfiles repo][dotfiles] but you can easily change it to use yours.
Works for all dotfile repos that follow the [stow][stow] format ([blog post](https://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html)).

## Usage

1. Change the `dotfiles_repo` variable in `defaults/main.yml` to point to your dotfiles repo
2. Create a playbook with this Role
3. Run the playbook

## Dependencies

None

## Example playbook

The main difference between the original project and this one is the usage of [stow][stow].
